## Order Desk App based on Simple CRM

This is an example application originally generated by BlueMix boilerplate.

For more information on this code, read the developerWorks article [Use Vaadin in the cloud for a
full-stack Java app](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-use-vaadin-in-the-cloud-for-a-full-stack-Java-app-bluemix/index.html).

Features of this code include:

 * The app uses a relational database for persistence, namely DB2 during deployment into BlueMix. Feel free to configure any RDBMS for local development.
 * The data is accessed through JPA and EJB using container managed transactions.
 * A rich HTML5 UI implemented with Vaadin Framework in plain Java for easy modification and maintenance. For more information and documentation on Vaadin see [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com)
 * Built in mobile support, with responsive design.

*Note, setting up the database schema and test data may take a while on first run.*
